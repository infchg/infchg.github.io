#  🌌 Interest: Thinking about fundamental questions


# Steps when Exploring the Nature of Quantum Information

- Steps taken: Theoretical [Physics-Based-Information-Models](#-Physics-Based-Information-Models) published with QKD examples. 
- Recent research on [QI-Tools-Applications](#-QI-Tools--Applications) with Hilbert space and Bloch sphere
- Next proposal: inter-disciplinary collaboration [planned 2022-23](#planned-2022-23) nearby NYC, by bringing:
   - Two decades achieving complex IT goals, by integrating Teams, Hardware, Instruments, Bus, Linux, Network, DevOps, Python, Cloud 
   - & Ability to understand the theory, matrix operators, eigenstates, ... and some notions learnt from experimentalists and QisKit 

# Planned 2022-23

*Part-time* due to current commitment delivering a technology project full-time:

- 2022 submitting new journal paper on Bloch & QI framework 
- 2023 Q1Q2 collaborations nearby NY towards cloud quantum computing

## 📕 Reference Principles & Productivity Ideas
### Delivering by Agile & Modern https://modernagile.org/

Fostering Models & Methods in collaborations:

Historic agile XP boosted interdisciplinary teams since 2001, from teams analyzing data to developers to hardware engineers accessing states at tiny fractions of a second. ModernAgile has four pillars: 
- People collaborations enhanced (Git & Jupyter Notebooks);
- Repeat and Continuously Improve (automated pipelines); 
- allowing rapid experimentation;
-  Safety came from approaching goals  in consumer/provider pairs, effectively avoiding hw/sw/coders overwhelmed or consumers/analysts/theorist disappointed.

   Continuous-->Safe;
   Safe-->Rapid;
   Rapid-->People;
   
```

Why ?

Generic & Simple frameworks boost human innovation, helping rapid building & repetition:
   In the 70s, the DoD's Internet Protocol made easy to grow communications exponentially. In the 90’s the CERN's Web open format radically boosted the information exchange. In 201x's QC offer on cloud gave seamless access to Quantum Computers for hundreds of thousands researchers. 


Own method refined from Industry Agile Six Sigma: Listen and innovate designs, measure, analyze, continuously automate, communicate and control.

#  🌌 Thinking about fundamental questions

- Interest: Physics, Quantum Information, inter-disciplinary collaboration [planned 2022-23](#planned-2022-23)
- Steps taken: published on [](#Physics-Based-Information-Models), researching [QI-Tools-Applications](#QI-Tools-Applications)
- Experienced: achieved complex IT goals integrating Teams, Hardware, Instruments, Bus, Linux, Network, DevOps, Python, Cloud 

Generic & Simple frameworks boost human innovation, helping rapid building & repetition:
   In the 70s, the DoD's Internet Protocol made easy to grow communications exponentially. In the 90’s the CERN's Web open format radically boosted the information exchange. In 201x's IBM's QisKit started seamless access to Quantum Computers for hundreds of thousands researchers. 

 
# Planned 2022-23

Part-time Due to completing a tech project full-time currently:

- 2022 submitting new journal paper on Bloch & QI framework 
- 2023 Q1Q2 collaborations nearby NY towards cloud quantum computing

#  🌱 Physics-Based Information Models 

Proposed Physics-Based Models (alike Toffoli, Benioff, Kirchoff) and Feynman-charts of Information Change.

#  🌱 QI Tools & Applications 

Exploring common frameworks to represent light modes coding qubits across diverse experiments

  -  on Bloch-R3 tools accross diverse physical modes, orbital, temporal, parity, spin, … much improved from public preprint  researchgate.net/publication/356697550_Comparative_Analysis_of_Spin_Paths_Temporal_and_Spatial_Modes

  <h1>on Generic frameworks for Quantum & Information</h1>
<p>  Generic frameworks boosted human innovation, sustained on simple ways to build and repeat setups:
 	 <p>In the 70s, the DoD's Internet Protocol  made easy to grow communications exponentially. In the 90â€™s the CERN's Web open format radically boosted the information exchange. In 201x's IBM's QisKit started seamless access to Quantum Computers for hundreds of thousands researchers.

 
  <h2>Information-Change: Planned, Recent, and Past Models</h2>

Research slows down in 2022 due to completing an Industry program full-time.
  
       
  </ul>    
<p> Origin: Physics-Based Model of Information (alike Toffoli, Benioff, Kirchoff)
 and Feynman-charts of Information Change.
